New win condition is Hold the Sack, which requires player to hold Sack of Gold for required number of days. Note that protecting garrisons are destroyed so players can finish Hold the Sack with just eliminating other players. Players have only small secluded starting areas, everything else is shared.", "There are lots of hero enchancements, mainly placed in order for player to have more strong heroes.

It contains quite complex script, but does not require other scripts to function so it is easy to copy to new maps. The player has option also to remove any number of computer players (though if you`re playing solo you can`t remove the last one obviously).

Easiest route for example has no costs or guardians but the route is quite long and in that short time your opponent might have already developed over your army's capabilities. Or (s)he might have taken shorter route to your town and captured it while you were sightseeing. The closest route either costs 10 000 gold. There are quite a few treasure areas, both shared and reserved.

This allows the players to see what your opponents has constantly and possibly harm them more than just mere AI could, and of course to have something to do during your opponents turn.

King of the Hill on the other hand requires player to capture and hold central castle for required amount of days (again, the required amount can be set up by players). The players are protected from each other by border gates and each player has sizable safe zone to train heroes and collect treasures to enable to player to get back on business even after having been defeated in battle. Victory conditions are, of course, on shared areas with variety of treasuries. In Deathmatch though, these border gates are removed so players can play the map standard-like if they wish.

Especially Domination mode is rather straightforwardly from UT. I was quite bored that so many of the multiplayer maps had just the standard victory condition and was looking to make something new for this game. King of the Hill and Deathmatch (again, concept taken from FPS games) modes were added to the map later. I do not like graphics of this map much, especially underground as a whole is rather bland and the terrain changes rather abruptly. Nevertheless, there are some fine spots in the maps that please my aesthetics senses, especially the desert and some of the ponds.

Instead with Positive energy setting player`s ally gets them, with negative the player`s ally`s opponent get them and spirit leaders is combination of both.

In this map I wanted to put emphasis on large armies with strong heroes, and I think I`ve certainly succeeded. There are lots of power-ups for heroes and the main scripts do make large armies. Even though I`ve never played this map in multiplayer, especially the Negative Energy should be a challenging feat for players since every battle has be weighed carefully because your opponent is getting the defeated creatures (excluding undead ones on the surface).

Both have branching story and players have only single creature (in Trapped this is possibly only initially). Lots of things have been improved in Trapped though, including the journal and food system. There exists some oddities with the scripts, but the map was done with 2.0 version of the editor so those oddities were actually often necessities. Considering this is largely story based map, there are a whole lot of scripts in it, with some of them pretty complex. Definitely over 100 separate events. The map has been criticized as a way too hard, and I agree that I should have given the players way more info about how the food and water are required to stay alive and some other tips, obviously the NAQ wasn't enough. But overall, I am pretty pleased about the map. I'm unsure how Equilibris  will affect this map, but I think some of the battles could become impossible to beat because of creature stat changes.
