        "description": "The realm of Erythea is in turmoil. Mirageans have contacted High Elves with intent of purging the world from evil. The Wizards of Thalark have summoned foul demons to aid them in the world conquest. Dark Elves and Lich King have formed an unholy alliance against the other races. And Dwarves are eager  to battle anyone who threatens their borders. Or their gold.",
        "comments": ["Erythia is an allied map with 4 teams. There are various treasure areas in the map both on land and sea.", "This is my first published Heroes 5 map. It is for Tribes of the East as will my future maps be. I just wanted to make a fun allied map with every faction in it and different areas. The map is not designed to be balanced or challenging, just fun to play. And I think I did succeed on fun-factor. The layout of the Erythia is based on old Warlords 2: Deluxe map, a map I have quite enjoyed playing in the past."]
